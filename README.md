Description
-----------

This piece of code calculates the optically induced damage threshold of
mirrors, given certain parameters and data files, obtained from _one_
experimental setup in particular. Thus most probably it will be only useful
to people working with that setup.

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.6.x or 2.7.x
- SymPy 0.7.0 or later
- matplotlib (only tested with v0.99)

If using Python 2.6.x, argparse module is also needed. (argparse is part of 
the standard library in 2.7.x)
